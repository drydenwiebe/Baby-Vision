# Baby-Vision
A baby monitor with face detection functionality as part of a project which inludes a web app. It is run on a Raspberry Pi and sends the images (with faces) to the backend defined in the POST URL.

This was made in early 2019 but is bieng posted to GitHub in late 2019 for posterity. This is part of a larger project but my group members code is omitted. 

The code that is included in this repo is the face detection and compression code that I wrote for this project. The classifier data was taken from another source.
